### Progress Summary

**1. Rebranding & Repository Setup**
*   **New Name:** The project has been successfully renamed to **ULTRA** (*ULTRA Lays Tiles Right Away*).
*   **GitHub Repo:** Created and pushed to `https://github.com/iurysza/ultra`.
*   **Assets:** Cleaned up the directory structure. Moved `hero-keyboard.png` to `assets/` and removed unused images. Added a `LICENSE` file.

**2. Demo Video Integration**
*   You added a demo video (`demo.webm`) to the `assets/` folder.
*   **Current Issue:** The video is not rendering in the GitHub README because GitHub's Markdown parser sanitizes/ignores raw HTML `<video>` tags for security reasons.

### Next Steps

**1. Fix Video Embedding**
As per the GitHub documentation you shared and standard behavior, GitHub automatically renders video files when the link is placed on its own line.

**Action:** Update `README.md` to remove the HTML tag and use the raw link format.

**Change this:**
```html
<video src="https://github.com/iurysza/ultra/raw/main/assets/demo.webm" controls width="100%"></video>
```

**To this:**
```markdown
https://github.com/iurysza/ultra/assets/demo.webm
```
*(Note: Using the raw link or the blob link usually works, but GitHub specifically looks for the URL on a blank line to transform it into a player).*

**2. Verify & Polish**
*   Commit and push the README fix.
*   Check the repository page to ensure the video player loads correctly.
*   Double-check that the `hero-keyboard.png` is also rendering correctly.
